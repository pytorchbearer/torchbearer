### Changed
- Changed the order of the arguments to the lambda function in the EpochLambda metric for consistency with pytorch and other metrics
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
- Fixed tests which were failing as of version 0.1.2

- Added support for torch dtypes in bink Model.to(...)
- Added pickle_module and pickle_protocol to checkpointers for consistency with torch.save
### Changed
- Changed the learning rate scheduler callbacks to no longer require an optimizer and to have the proper arguments
