- ``torchbearer.Trial`` has for_x_steps and for_steps to allow running of trails without explicit generators or data tensors

- ``torchbearer.Trial.state_dict`` now returns the trial history and callback list state allowing for full resuming of trials
- ``torchbearer.Trial`` has a replay method that can replay training (with callbacks and display) from the history. This is useful when loading trials from state.
- The backward call can now be passed args by setting ``state[torchbearer.BACKWARD_ARGS]``
- ``torchbearer.Trial`` implements the forward pass, loss calculation and backward call as a optimizer closure
- Metrics are now explicitly calculated with no gradient
### Changed
- Callback decorators can now be chained to allow construction with multiple methods filled
- Callbacks can now implement ``state_dict`` and ``load_state_dict` to allow callbacks to resume with state

- Checkpointer callbacks will now resume from a state dict when resume=True in Trial
### Deprecated
- ``torchbearer.Model`` has been deprecated in favour of the new ``torchbearer.Trial`` api

### Changed
- Timer callback can now also be used as a metric which allows display of specified timings to printers and has been moved to metrics.
