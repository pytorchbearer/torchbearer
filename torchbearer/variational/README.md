## About
Torchbearer.variational is a sub-package of [torchbearer](https://github.com/ecs-vlc/torchbearer) which is intended to
re-implement state of the art models and practices relating to the world of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). The goal
is to provide everything from useful abstractions to complete re-implementations of papers. This is in order to support
both research and teaching / learning regarding VAEs.
